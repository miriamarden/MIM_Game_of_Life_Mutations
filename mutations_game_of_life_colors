%The user can set a specific number of normal live cells, or the number of live normal cells can be randomly generated.
num_alive = randi(10000);

%The user can set the number of mutations that the array starts out with.
num_initial_mutations = 100;

%The user can set the colors of the live cells, dead cells, and mutated cells. For example, setting a=1, b=, and c= makes the live cells yellow. The following color combinations can be used for reference:
% Black: (0,0,0)      White: (1,1,1)      Red: (1,0,0)    Green: (0,1,0)      Blue: (0,0,1)
% Yellow: (1,1,0)     Teal: (0,1,1)       Pink: (1,0,1)

%Set the color for the live cells
a=1;
b=1;
c=1;

%Set the color for the dead cells 
d=0;
e=0;
f=0;

%Set the color for the mutated cells 
g=1;
h=0;
i=0;

%initialize the current generation matrix as all dead cells
initial = ones(100,100);
current_gen = cat(3,d*initial, e*initial, f*initial);

%Initialize the color channels given the initial array with all dead cells
red_channel = current_gen(:,:,1);
green_channel = current_gen(:,:,2);
blue_channel = current_gen(:,:,3);


%This section randomly determines the location of the live normal cells in the initial generation.
for alive = 1:num_alive
    mutation_location = [randi(100),randi(100)];
    red_channel(mutation_location(1),mutation_location(2)) = a;
    green_channel(mutation_location(1),mutation_location(2)) = b;
    blue_channel(mutation_location(1),mutation_location(2)) = c;
end


%This section randomly determines the location of the mutations in the initial generation.
for mut = 1:num_initial_mutations
    mutation_location = [randi(100),randi(100)];     
    
    red_channel(mutation_location(1),mutation_location(2)) = g;

    blue_channel(mutation_location(1),mutation_location(2)) = i;
end

%This establishes current generation array, which now contains dead cells, live cells, and mutated cells.
current_gen = cat(3,red_channel, green_channel, blue_channel);

%This loop runs forever. The function "mutations_check_neighbors_colors" takes the current generation of cells and applies the rules to result in the new generation of cells.
%Then, what was the new generation becomes the current generation for the next iteration, and the loop repeats again.
while true
    [new_gen] = mutations_check_neighbors_colors(current_gen);
